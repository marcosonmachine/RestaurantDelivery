# Description
Implementing front-end using RESTApi (https://food-delivery.kreosoft.ru/swagger/index.html).

# Summary 
I feel that this code still need a lot of refactoring, I certainly have made a lot of noobie mistakes in this project. I hope don't do frontend in future else it would be embarassing to see this project, I will use it as an excuse not to choose frontend.
        
## Tech Stack

**Language:** Typescript

**Client:** React, TailwindCSS

**Server:** Node, NextJs


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://git.hits.tsu.ru/AdityaLohuni-Projects/en_web_front-EN-Frontend-project-1.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd en_web_front-EN-Frontend-project-1
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run dev
```


## Learnings

This is probably the first time I wrote a front-end app. "It all looks easy from down here" but it's not easy at all, working up the rings certainly is like a construction worker who works at heights.    
Tailwind css works really well and made it a lot easier.    
I couldn't find a good reason for typescript to exist. It's interpreted anyways, although it make sense if the code is written to be modular but why not webassembly then?  
NextJS is something different on its own. It comes with amazing features like routing, grouping, Image optimization, server side fetching, APIs and a lot more to find.     
I could have saved a lot of refactoring if I would have read documentation in the first place. Unfortunately the documentation is not good enough either function definitions are missing, use of certain features isn't explained well. 

*Sometimes writing higher level code feels like cheating but it has potential to do wonders if u dare.*

## Motivation
**No Browser:** What I felt is that a lot of energy and time is being wasted just to make things work on top of this thing called browser. The tech and idea is very old, I think there's some room for change in this idea. Although the crazy thing about the browser is that thousands of developers has accepted it as a sole platform for their development. It's another magical thing about the front end that it has done what no team lead or manager can do.

**WebAssembly:** It would be something interesting to explore. Although it's an interface provided within JS hence I cannot conclude anything. Would like to see the implementaion of WebAssembly, it may be the solution to the browser problem.# RestaurantDelivery
